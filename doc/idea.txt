Lucius - the narrating protagonist of all segments. And each of them
came with a different personality.

Actor A

Actor B

Actor C - always a male.

=====

Very Kafkaesque

Bureaucratic, dehumanizing, and frustrating.

Similar to Pathologic games.

There are three actors, and each plays a different character in each
segment.

You have to make an illegal ("unthinkable") action to get to your
goal.

Each segment has its own default ending, but contains more than two
endings. Each they might have some impact toward other segment (but
only as a flashback humor).

Set in three different locations (dressing room, green room, bar, and
outside).

Everyone is not having a healthy and "normal" relationship.

=====

[Segment Z]
A ménage à trois drama about the evil aristocrats who want to get into
your pants - in the middle of a plague. You got yourself in a 4D chess
game of politics where each house tried to dominate the entirey of the
society.

[Segment Y]
The protagonist "killed" an important diety, and it seems like the
mortal spouse of his demi-god children asked you to do so. How you,
the giant rag doll with a human soul, killed him is a mystery of
itself.

[Segment X]
It's a third segment, but it always involves the number 4. Your
lost-long biological father return to your life, and realized that
your fiancee might be related to you by blood. As you try to get out
of the situation, you began to loose your identity.

[Framing narrative]
Lucius, four actors, and the director discuss about a segment they
acted in.
